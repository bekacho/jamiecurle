I've been mulling this over for a while and this morning I decided to jump into the deep end and delete all my tweets. This is another step towards something I'm aiming to acheive in 2012 - no use of free third party services.  

At [d.construct][0] last year, I think it was Don Norman that said

> ... if you're not paying for it, you're the product.

Well this year I plan to make sure that I minimise (_or even eradicate_)  being a product.

I don't blame companies for using data (_that I provide as part of the normal useage of a free product_), to deliver targeted advertising to me - but I don't have to like it. I take responsibility for handing it over in the first case.

It may be a valid statement to say that the growth of the internet and web in general would not have been possible without corporate sponsorship. I certainly wouldn't want to see that reversed, the web has opened up many previously closed doors. 

However, if the decisions we make and the actions we take shape the world around us, then I at least want to try and shape a world in which the invasion of advertising is kept in check. No matter how funny, well executed or tastefully done, advertising is an attempt to change your will for commercial exploit. That's not cool with me. It's even more uncool when advertisers are able to reach me by slicing through demographical information - especially when I was the one to hand over that demographical information in the first place. If I was Homer Simpson, now would be the right time to say "Doh".

So that's where all of my tweets have went. In the bin.
