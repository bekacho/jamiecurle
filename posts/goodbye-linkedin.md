This morning I was alerted to the fact that Linkedin had enabled 'social advertising' on my profile without asking my permission.  This was the last straw for me as it's becoming a source of pain for me to keep and update that profile.

## Top Headlines in Internet

Earlier this year I started receiving emails from them on the subject of 'Top Headlines in Internet' and I found this very annoying and it prompted me to swiftly disable them. The problem isn't that they're sending me crap like that (although I wish they wouldn't) the problem is that I signed up to Linkedin because it appeared to be way to keep my professional life intact and in one place, where people could see it. In 2007 this seemed like a good idea, but I'm not sure why.  

But they're a company and they've recently went public so now they've got a responsibility to their shareholders as well as to me, but it looks like the board is placing the emphasis on profit and reach -  meaning terrible ideas like "Top Headlines in Internet" become more important than happy users. 

I don't expect my toaster to give me the weather information so why the hell do I want Linkedin to give me the "Top Headlines in Internet"?


## Deleted

With every year that passes I get happier that I'm not part of the Facebook monster. I deleted my account in 2007 and that was pure pain, I had to delete every pirate and zombie request, every message, every wall post, every contact and every photo. But it was worth it.[Beacon][1] was a wake up call for me about social networks and how the service they provide to their users is ultimately about making money. If the user isn't paying for it, then someone's going to have to generate some income and that only leaves the data...

Today I got the distinct impression that Linkedin is heading down that very same route. So I deleted my account, it was a painless process, though I did make sure to manually remove the content before I deleted the account - just incase they kept the profile data, but deleted my ability to wipe it clean.


## Take Responsibility For My Own Network

I liked Linkedin because I could keep my professional network in one place, it was easy, but I think the time has come to take responsibility for myself. There's a redesign of this site about to go live soon and as part of that I'll be spending a lot of time  (as part of my MA) putting in place something that communicates my professional skills and experience in a manner a little more engaging than static text. 


## Does Linkedin have value for the user?

I never subscribed to the service, it was way more than I wanted to pay for the service when I last looked, but to be honest I've noticed more and more that having 'lots of connections' (whatever that means) seems to be more important than the quality of the network you're connected to.  For example I've had a few requests from people that I've never met, never done business with, have never exchanged any form of dialouge with and we're not even in the same industry - why?

Personally I don't think it does have value for the user and I can't say for certain whether or not it's had any benefit for me as a professional.


## Aren't you just spitting out your dummy?

Yes.
