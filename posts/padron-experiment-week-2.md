On the 19th of May I repotted all of the plants into new 2 litre pots. I suspect that at some point in June I will need to plant them into their final pots where some of the plants will be outside and few will remain in the greenhouse. This may skew the results a little bit, but this isn't a multi-million pound experiment, it's for me and other humble small scale growers who are looking to get the most out of a season.

I realised as I was taking the measurements that I had made a silly decision to measure from the soil to the growing tip because the soil will compact and give the false impression of growth. So I've abandoned the week 0 readings and I'm now measuring from the seed leaves to the growing tip. #foolproof.

There's a few signs of new growth nodes coming through but they're too early to count so for this week it's just height.

They've all been given the same amount of feed this week - 170ml.  Here's a group picture.

They've grown quite nicely since the start.
