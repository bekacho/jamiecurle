I'm not able to have a large green house for a number of reasons, so I really wanted my own chilli jungle.  By the end of June I was starting to get what I had planned.

My cherry bomb plants were doing great this year, until around the third week in July. After a long wet three weeks the plants started dropping a lot of blossom, then leaves and then stems. I had an unwelcome visitor -- some form of disease.

I don't know what it is, but if I had to guess I'd say it was caused by a combination of little air movement, damp overcast weather and a little too much watering.  I'll fix the factors that I can control next year.
