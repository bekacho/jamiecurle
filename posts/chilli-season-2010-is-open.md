I was a little worried when I germinated these plants this year. I had about thirty minutes to get them sown before I went on holiday for a week.  When I returned all was good, almost everything germinated.   So this year, this is what I'm growing

* Orange Bhuts
* Dorset Naga ( seeds from some pods bought at Tesco ) 
* Naga Morich ( seeds from some pods bought at local asian food store )
* Scotch Bonnet ( seeds from some pods bought at local asian food store ) 
* Long Habanero
* Etna
* Cherry Bomb ( seeds from some pods bought at Tesco ) 

I'm taking a gamble with the seeds that I'm growing from purchased pods, but I'm ok with that.  Here's the little seedlings.

Finally after sitting in the garage for a month,  managed to get some time to put the greenhouse up. I'm really excited about this because it means a more stable environment for my little beauties.
