I was reading a blog post by [Lee Simpson][lee] a few days ago on the subject of [simpler UI design][lee:ui] and it got me thinking.  Recently I've been really impressed with some of the new apps ( mobile  & web ) that are coming into usage and there seems to be a trend. The trend seems to focus around doing a very particular task. Here's four examples that spring to mind ( If you can think of anymore, I'd love to know about them in comments ) 

* [Min.us][minus] - Sharing application with a rather nice twist. No upload dialogue, just drag and drop files into the browser.
* [Teux Deux][teux] - Todo application that is minimal. List thing todo on day or someday.
* [Letterly][letterly] - Publish a newsletter and charge people to subscribe to it.
* [Readability][read] - Save things to read for later in a way that makes sense to you
* [Droplr][drop] - Share files from a mac by dropping onto an icon
* [About.Me][about] - An about me page


It would have been easy to for anyone of these ideas to be part of a larger app, but they're not. They exist in isolation doing one thing and doing them well.  It makes me re-think a few things, especially one personal project that's been lying around for a while - [redirect-o-matic.com][redirect]
