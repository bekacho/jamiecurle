Dear Lord Lloyd-Webber, 

I am deeply concerned with the future of the NHS. I'm writing to you today to respectfully ask you to take time out of your schedule to read a [briefing prepared by a team of independent legal experts][1]. 

The NHS may not be perfect and it is certainly not without problems but I believe we simply must impress upon the secretary of state that there is a duty to provide a health service. The ever changing attitude towards the NHS was not a part of any manifesto neither was it mentioned in the coalition agreement.

Whilst I was studying towards my undergraduate degree I spent three years working part time for the now defunct Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA). Over the course of the three years I went from a data entry clerk to management. Many of the experiences that I took from that period of employment I use today in my current practice as a creative educator and interaction designer. It may have not have been a core part of the NHS, but the PPA remains part of my history.

Myself and my family have all been treated and employed by the NHS at some stage in our lives. I hope that our children and their children can expect the same level of service from the NHS as my parents and grandparents have experienced. 

I'm not against capitalism, as a director of a VAT registered company it is the framework from which I provide for my family. But I do not believe that the NHS can be better served by privatisation. The number one goal of the NHS has to be to provide free healthcare to all, not profit. If privatisation is given the green light I fear that shareholders and profit will be primary objectives, patients will become customers and treatment becomes a packaged tangible service with options and loyalty cards. 

My ultimate concern is that approval of this legislation would provide the crack from which Friedman style economic policy would creep into our health service. Please prevent this from happening. Privatisation of the energy sector has not helped customers. We're paying more for our supplies whilst providers enjoy record profits. This cannot happen to the NHS.

I would urge you to read the independent report and assert upon the secretary of state that there is a duty to provide the NHS to the country that elected it.

With Respect, 

Mr Jamie Curle.
