I'm not very good at handstands. Even as a child I was never been able to stay up for long before my balance failed me. This year however, I plan to change that.

Here's one of many videos as to why handstands are immense. It is not me in the video.

## Walking Before I Run

It'll take a while before I can crack out moves like the above video (_and I'm certainly not sure my wrists will take hammering_), but I'll start with simply being to do an unassisted handstand and hold it for a twenty seconds. A goal for this year is to be able to get into an unassisted handstand and crack out ten handstand push-ups.
