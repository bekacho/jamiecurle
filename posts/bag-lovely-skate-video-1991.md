I was really young when we made this and I had a real blast doing it.  I want to thank "dead mike" for uploading this.

You can catch me at 1min20 taking a nice tumble and faceplant  and my "section" is at 6mins.

The video features a number of skaters who went onto become pro, including Neil Urwin and Harry the Bastard.  If you were in this video I'd love to hear from you.  

Enough nostalgia, there's work to do!
