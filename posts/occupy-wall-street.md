Something is happening around the world. Something important and from  a few steps back it all seems connected. 

[Economies don't collapse without a cause][0]. [People don't riot without a reason][1]. [Governments shouldn't be bailing out big business and banks][3]. [You don't get record unemployment at the same time as global corporations are experiencing their highest profits in history][2]. Yet this is exactly what's happening. 

Watching all these events unfold and develop in the world around me is making it harder and harder to ignore - especially when I find myself agreeing – totally – with the reason and logic behind the [peaceful occupation of Wall St][6].

## Want to know a bit more?

Business Insider has a nice article [linking the data to what the Wall St. protesters are so angry about][2].  [Anon Ops][7] (as usual) has lots of information about the occupation and there is also a [website dedicated to Occupy Wall St][7]. 

As a bit of further digestible information, if you have a spare hour and half to kill and you're in the UK I'd urge you to also digest [The Shock Doctrine][4] narrated by Noami Klein. If you're feeling really special, go buy [the dead tree version][5]
