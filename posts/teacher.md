I don't like the label teacher because it suggests that learning is something that happens when a teacher teaches something to a student. 

It suggests that the student simply has to accept the information from the teacher. 

It implies that learning is one way process from teacher to student.

I could teach you. That wouldn't mean that you'd learn and it's certainly doesn't mean that you'd understand.You might say that's because I'm not a very good teacher â€“ you might be right.

Great teachers don't teach. Great teachers enable students to be great. 

Great teachers light a fire under the student that fuels the students desire to know the how, what, where, when and why of the subject.  

Great teachers connect the subject to the student. There is no "one size fits all" student to subject connector. You cannot buy them on Ebay. Each and everyone is bespoke.

Great teachers help students create their own frameworks for learning. It belongs to the student and it is theirs for life.

Great teachers spend most of their time listening, not talking.

Bad teachers teach.
