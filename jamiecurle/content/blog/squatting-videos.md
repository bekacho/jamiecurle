The squat is one of the cornerstone lifts that you can do as lifter. But getting your form wrong under a heavy load could be crippling at the worst or the cause of an injury at the least - either way you're going to regret it. The internet is full of videos on "how to do squat/deadlift/press" but for the most part, I don't have a lot of confidence in them. There are exceptions to this.

## Mark Rippetoe

Authored "[Starting Strength][2]" with [Lon Kilgore][1]. If you're new to strength training, this is a must read ( very expensive to get in the UK) but the book is great for demonstrating and explaining the form of the squat. Following this last programme last year I was able to take my squat from 50kg to something a little more respectable.

Here's some great starting videos where

## Matt Wenning - EliteFTS

I was compelled to write this blog post after watching these videos from [Matt Wenning of EliteFTS][2] because they're a great diagnosis on a lot of common problems. The one difference in suggestions between the two lifters is the angle of the eyes when squatting. Mark Rippetoe favours looking  slightly downward at the floor, rather than slightly upward and at the ceiling.  There is a an [interview between Jim Wendler of EliteFTS and Mark Rippetoe][2] where this is discussed ( around 5m:50s in ), but it boils down to whatever works for you, as long as your form is correct. The main thing is that you're squatting.

## Be safe

Don't be that person who "watched a video" on the internet and then went and near killed themselves.  These resources are great, but watching them once doesn't qualify you to throw 200kg over your back.  If you have a phone, video yourself at low weights and scrutinise  your form in comparison to some of the excellent advice out there. If you're honest with yourself you'll know when to push yourself and when to not listen to your ego.

These made me laugh and I'm sure they can take it on the chin.

I'd love to know if anyone else has anything to add to this.
