## Introduction

This year I attempted to grow a lot of Pimientos de Padróns in an attempt to satiate a huge desire for their delicious pods. I began with 12 in total, but I've lost a few to over watering, left a four to 'fend for themselves' (_after initially incorrectly diagnosing them with a disease, when I had simply overwatered them_) and given four away. This has left me with all but two decent specimens — one in the NFT and one in large pot (_a 12L builders bucket_) in the greenhouse.

At the end of March I sowed more Padron seeds and this has yielded me four seedlings.  At the same time I also ordered five plug plants from [Potters Plants][1]. The plug plants arrived yesterday and they were roughly the same size as my home grown seedlings. Obviously I want to get them to grow a healthy root system and plenty of foliage as fast as possible so they prepare themselves for ( hopefully ) a huge harvest.  This is where the idea for this DIY experiment came to me based on the anecdotal (and contradictory ) accounts given to me by a range of people. Some people swear by one fertiliser, others another and some none. 

Nutrients are the only variable I can really control in my greenhouse now because the propagator and lights have been been packed away to make room for other plants which are starting to get rather big. 

I'm hoping to find a method that is suited to my environment that I can iterate on over time to growth strong vigorous plants that will maxmise my yield per plant.

## Hypothesis

Soil grown Pimientos de Padróns that are dosed with the correct balance of nutrients will grow more vigorously than those that are just fed on water.

## Methods

* Two groups, each containing four plants. 
* All plants are (roughly) the same size
* Group one has been grown by myself
* Group two have been grown by Potters Plants.
* All plants have been potted into a 70/30 mix of compost and perlite.
* Plant A from each group will receive a high nitrogen feed only ( NPK 24-8-16 ) 
* Plant B from each group will receive a tomato plant food only ( NPK 4-4.5-8 )
* Plant C from each group will receive a high nitrogen feed for four weeks and then switch to a tomato plant food 
* Plant Z from each group will act as a control and will only receive water.
* Plants will be repotted into 3L pots when visible roots are showing at the the bottom of their current pots
* The experiment will end on the 1st of July. 
* Quantitive data will be height and node count.
* Qualitative data will be photographic evidence.
* Measurements will be taken once per week on a Sunday morning.


## Starting Data


Some of the plants are planted into different pots and I could have changed this as this could be a variable for success. I could have transplanted them into the same sized pots but this could have caused shock and stunted the plants growth.

Initial height measurements would suggest that the plants are not at the same stage of growth. This is not the case. The discrepancy between the heights is caused by the depth to which the plug plants have been transplanted ( to their seed leaves ).

Also the plug plants have all had a dosage of a high nitrogen based feed when the arrived into my care.
