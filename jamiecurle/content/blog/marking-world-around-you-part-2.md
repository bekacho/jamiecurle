This week I've asked the [HTML & CSS from the Beginning class][1] to expand on the [exercise from last week][2] and to repeat the idea, but this week getting an example for a range of tags and also to apply id and class names where they see fit.

I've also asked them to comment the code explaining their choice of subject, thought process and anything else that they wish to share with me. 

For those of you that are interested you can view [my marked up file][3] or the [larger photo][4] on [dropbox][5]
