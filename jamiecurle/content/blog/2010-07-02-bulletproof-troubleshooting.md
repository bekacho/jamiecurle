Using 4 steps I have never failed to solve any problem. You may have to do some abstract thinking in a situation to get the steps to fit, but I guarantee they’ll work.

1. Is it plugged in?
2. Is it switched on?
3. Have you checked?
4. Check again.

It's important that as soon as you encounter the problem that you say to yourself "is this plugged in" and think about all the ways in which something can be plugged in - not literally of course and you may have to think abstractly.

It’s very rare that I get to step four. It’s nearly always steps 1 or 2.
