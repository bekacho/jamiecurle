Today is the second week of lectures ( _or rather the content is great but they're hideously implemented java chat sessions_ ) in my MA.  Two of the modules are quite closely related to each other, Reflective Practice and Project Proposition. 

I was intending this to be a blog post about what Action Research and Reflective practice are, but having read about them over the last week and discussed them today, I actually think writing about what they are is bit silly. 

I think I'll learn much  more about the two practices by actually __doing__ them. This is not to say that I'll stop learning about them, but they'll have infinitely more relevance to me if I've got a purpose to fulfill.
