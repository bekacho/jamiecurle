###  The Foundation.

Take an onion and garlic bagel and toast it to perfection. Once done add a smearing of butter (not margerine - pah!) and add slithers of fresh chilli. Here I've used dorset naga, orange bhut (unripe) and habanero.

### The Bacon Drape

Take your bacon - I like mine crispy and lay it out on that bread as if it were barely clad beauty lying on top of a sports car.

### Tomato

The tomato is added for taste and to also add to the flavour of the chillies. Here I've used a green sausage tomato because they were ready for eating, but out of season you can use any tomato that grabs your fancy.

### The Black Pudding 

I used to hate black pudding - then one day I woke up and couldn't stop thinking about it. Since then I've been hooked.  Add the black pudding around the top like petals on a plant ( and add a little more bacon because [bacon is good for you][1])

### Top Off

Almost done, but before you can savour your meaty weekend treat, you've  got to add the last layer of buttered bagel.

Yes, the bagel is upside down, but I just wanted to eat it and not re-photograph it.

Om nom nom.
