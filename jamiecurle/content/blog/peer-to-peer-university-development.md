Time isn't something I have a lot of at the moment, but when I found out that the codebase for P2PU is being ported from Drupal to Django, I had to check it out.  

Having worked exclusively with Django for four years now, but always within [C&C Design][2], it'll be refreshing to contribute back to larger project. Following the instructions [I've forked it][1], and I'll start on a task as time permits.  Hopefully I'll prove myself worthy of a commit or two, which frankly, will make my day.
  
_p.s. If you're one of the devs from the group, then forgive my membership request, I was a little trigger happy with my clicks._
