Inspired by [the global bucket][1] I've wanted to build something that I could use to keep the plants nicely watered, but not over watered. There is also a minor sense of urgency to this as well, because the seedlings are desperate to be repotted!

### The Containers

I'm just using some bog standard 35lt plastic containers. They're quite opaque &mdash; this'll add extra work in blocking the light out later on.  In the picture below you'll notice that I've drilled 4&times;12mm holes in the boxes. These holes are where I'll be putting the bamboo struts in that will hold the soil bed. 

### The Wick

The wick is a central column of soil that is constantly submerged into the water reservoir. This allows water to be drawn up into the roots of the plant.  I've made the wicks by cutting plastic buckets ( purchased at ASDA for Â£1 ) into 3&rdquo; lengths. These pieces have then had plenty of holes drilled in them to allow for the movement of water.

### The Soil Bed

The soil bed lies about one inch above the top of the water level and it'll rest on the wire mesh shelf that I've fashioned for it.  

I'm going to be lining the planter with landscaping material and this material will stop the soil from failing into the water reservoir, however I need the soil to fall down into the wick. So I needed to cut out a hole.

### Line & Add Plants

All that's left to be done now it to line the containers, add the soil and the plants and we're done.  Unfortunately I was a little pushed for time due to the arrival of a new kitten, so I didn't photograph much of this part, but below you can see that I've done four and have three more to go. You can also see that in order to prevent light from getting into the water reservoir, I've wrapped the planters in more landscaping fabric.
