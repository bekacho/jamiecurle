## &lt;p&gt;


Paragraph was an easy choice -  I love taking photographs of [The Elements of Typographic Style][1]

## &lt;div&gt;


Div had me puzzled for a bit but I decided on bricks because div's really are just generic building blocks.

I had an old Times Educational Supplement at hand and I snapped an article from one of the pages.

## &lt;header&gt;

I just took delivery a new Noam Chomsky book last week, thought I'd use this as it does have a very clear header

## &lt;nav&gt;

Nav did have me puzzled for a few mins and then I though aha - Motorway signs! Eureka

Thanks to [Gary D][gd] for the photo

## &lt;footer&gt;

The bottom sole of a shoe makes for a good example of a footer I think.

## &lt;blockquote&gt;

So I took a bit of artistic license in this one. I drew a speech bubble coming from our cat, he's demanding fish.

## &lt;ol&gt;

Ordered lists, my old friend. Last time I used  a sketch of a bus stop, and there was a big reply of people informing me that people ( mostly from London I have to say ) were not ordered, but rather very unordered. So Instead I've opted for a load of geese flying in formation.  Thanks to [Neptune Canada for the photo][geese]

## &lt;ul&gt;

Just a random selection of DVD's from my collection.

## &lt;dl&gt;

Definition lists are tricky, I very rarely use them because I end up either breaking them down into heading tags and paragraphs or breaking them into lists. Not deterred I attacked my DVD collection and came up with this.  That'll do nicely.

## &lt;span&gt;

Span's are really tricky because they're the inline equivalent of a div - totally generic. I had an idea to use use some tape in a sentence of text, but I didn't have any tape. I opted for a highlighter instead.

## &lt;time&gt;

I think I should have tried a little bit harder with this one, but it's just too obvious. The time tag is for dates and times and I just couldn't  resist myself.
