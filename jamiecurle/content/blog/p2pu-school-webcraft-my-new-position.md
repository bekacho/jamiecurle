I've been sitting on this news for a few days and now I can't keep it in any longer â€“ the excitment is building up too much.

## The Job

About two weeks ago I noticed that P2PU were advertising for a few positions - one of which was for a Web Challenge Designer and it sounded right up my street. I'm not a stranger in the world of P2PU, I ran a short course on [HTML & CSS][3]  this year and it was very well recieved (although for a number of reasons we never quite made it to the CSS part). There was a lot of crossover from the job description with what I'd already been doing and there was a boat load of scope to develop the role in areas that I've been itching to explore.  Needless to say, I applied for, was offered and accepted the position

## Why P2PU?

If you've been reading my blog this year, know me personally or stalk me then you'll know that this year I finished my Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) and embarked on my Masters Degree in Design Professional Practice. As a consumer of  'traditional' education, I'm not about to state that I think university education is broken, because I don't think it is. However I do think that we need to change our expectations of traditional educational experiences and take more responsibility for our own learning. This is especially true in the domain of web techologies and sciences - a space where few universites excel at. I don't believe the role of universities is to prepare people for a career. To me, the role of university is to allow the learner to develop their own critial engagement with the world around them. It's the responsibility of the learner to prepare themselves for their careers and this is where organisations like P2PU come into play. 

## My Role

Getting back to my new role with P2PU - I'm a "Web Challenge Designer" and this translates to designing and developing a series of tasks that can engage the learner in either a linear  journey through a discipline ( in this case webcraft ) or in a non-linear manner for specifc topics that the learner wants to engage with.

The really important thing here is that the P2PU isn't a teacher - student environment, it is a peer to peer environment where humanistic and constructivist experiences are championed (I guess the clue is in the title!). There's loads of exciting work being done at P2PU right now and I can't really put into words, just how excited, motivated and if I'm honest - a little bit nervous* I am about my role in such an awesome project. 


I best wrap this up now because it's bed time and there is loads to do tomorrow at [c&c][4] and at the [P2PU Mozilla School of Webcraft][5]. THere was lots of stuff I wanted to say, but I haven't so I'll do that some other time.



**p.s.** - I would like to thank [Pippa Buchanan][7] aka [@pipstar][6] because she's been ultra supportive and generally awesome in the stuff I've been doing with P2PU. Pippa - thankyou :)
