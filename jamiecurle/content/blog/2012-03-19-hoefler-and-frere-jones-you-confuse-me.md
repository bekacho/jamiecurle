[Hoefler & Frere-Jones][0] craft some stunning fonts and they've sponsored every web conference I've been to in the last few years. What's really confusing though is that they don't allow [@font-face usage][0].

Apparently there is something on the way; but I want to use [Archer][2] on the web in a manner that's inline with html standards and a valid license.

So sponsor web conferences, don't allow @font face. Hoefler & Frere-Jones you're confusing me.
